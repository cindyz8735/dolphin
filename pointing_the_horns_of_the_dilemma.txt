The Dolphin, 1973
Doubt 2. Pointing the Horns of the Dilemma
From the dismay of <begin_diff_1> my old world to the blank
newâ€” <end_diff> water-torture of vacillation!
The true snakepit isn't monodrama Medea,
the gorgon arousing the serpents in her hair;
it's a room to walk <begin_diff_2> with no one else, to walk,
take thought, unthink the thought and listen for nothing: <end_diff>
<begin_diff_3> "She loves me too much to have my welfare at heart ... <end_diff>
<begin_diff_3> <begin_i> they <end_diff> just aren't up to your coming home
three weeks, then leaving for a year. <begin_diff_3> They <end_diff> just aren't.
<begin_diff_3> They <end_diff> can't <begin_diff_3> stand <end_diff> much more of anything,
<begin_diff_3> they <end_diff> are so tired and hurt and worn. <begin_diff_3> They <end_diff> go on,
knowing your real sickness is a <begin_diff_3> fretful <end_diff>
deafness to little children ... <begin_diff_3> and <end_diff> suspect
it's impossible for anyone to help you." <end_i>

Doubt 2. Pointing the Horns of the Dilemma
From the dismay of <begin_diff_1> old marriage to the blanks
in another--- <end_diff> water-torture of vacillation!
The true snakepit isn't monodrama Medea,
the gorgon arousing the serpents in her hair;
it's a room to walk, <begin_diff_2> take notes, cross out
the notes, and gaze and walk and court diversion. <end_diff>
<begin_diff_3> She loved me too much to have my welfare at heart: <end_diff>
<begin_diff_3> "We <end_diff> just aren't up to your coming home
three weeks, then leaving for a year. <begin_diff_3> We <end_diff> just aren't.
<begin_diff_3> We <end_diff> can't <begin_diff_3> take <end_diff> much more of anything,
<begin_diff_3> we <end_diff> are so tired and hurt and worn. <begin_diff_3> We <end_diff> go on,
knowing your real sickness is a <begin_diff_3> willful <end_diff>
deafness to little children ... <begin_diff_3> I <end_diff> suspect
it's impossible for anyone to help you."
