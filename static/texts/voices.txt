The Dolphin, 1973
Hospital II 1. Voices
"What a record year, even for us—
last March, <begin_diff_1> I knew <end_diff> you'd manage by yourself,
you were the true you; now finally
your clowning makes <begin_diff_2> visitors want to call a taxi, <end_diff>
<begin_diff_3> you tease the patients as if they were your friends, <begin_diff_1>
<begin_diff_4> your real friends who want to save your image <end_diff>
from this genteel, disgraceful hospital.
<begin_diff_5> Your trousers are worn to a mirror. <end_diff> ... That new <begin_diff_6> creature, <end_diff>
when I hear her name, I have to laugh.
You left two houses and two thousand books,
a workbarn by the ocean, and <begin_diff_7> two slaves <end_diff>
to kneel and wait upon you hand and foot—
tell us why in the name of Jesus." <begin_diff_8> Why
am I clinging here so foolishly alone? <end_diff>

you were the true you; now finally
your clowning makes <begin_diff_2> us want to vomit <end_diff> --- <begin_diff_4> you bore,
bore, bore the friends who wished to save your image <end_diff>
from <begin_diff_9> this <end_diff> genteel, disgraceful hospital.
<begin_diff_3> You tease the sick as if they were your friends; <end_diff>
<begin_diff_5> you suit is lazied to grease. <end_diff> ... And that new <begin_diff_6> woman--- <end_diff>
when I hear her name, I have to laugh.
