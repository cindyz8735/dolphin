From the dismay of my old world to the blank
newâ€”water-torture of vacillation!
The true snakepit isn't monodrama Medea,
the gorgon arousing the serpents in her hair;
it's a room to walk with no one else, to walk,
take thought, unthink the thought and listen for nothing:
"She loves me too much to have my welfare at heart ...
<begin_i> they just aren't up to your coming home
three weeks, then leaving for a year. They just aren't.
They can't stand much more of anything,
they are so tired and hurt and worn. They go on,
knowing your real sickness is a fretful
deafness to little children ... and suspect
it's impossible for anyone to help you." <end_i>
