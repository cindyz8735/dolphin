The Dolphin, 1973
Marriage 7. Green Sore
We wake too early, the sun's already up,
the too early chain-twitter of the swallows fatigues,
words of a moment's menace stay for life:
<begin_diff_1> <begin_i> not that I wish you entirely well, far from it. <end_i> <end_diff>
That was my green life, even heard through tears. ...
We pack, leave <begin_i> Milgate, <end_i> in a rush as usual
for the London train, leaving five lights burning—
to follow the burglar? Never the same five lights.
Sun never sets without our losing something,
keys, money—not everything. "Dear Caroline,
I have told Harriet that you are having a baby
by her father. <begin_diff_2> She knows she will seldom see him;
the physical presence or absence is the thing." <end_diff> —
a letter left in a page of a book and lost.

Dearest, do take care. Nothing is worth destroying yourself. You have worked hard, led a good life and you have the right to nothing I’m afraid. But it is always nice when there is not justice but good luck and you have happiness and what you want. <begin_diff_1> I don’t entirely wish you well, far from it, of course. <end_diff> But I still feel less angry with you than with those who have used you for their own childish, destructive purposes. Write to Harriet. That is very easy, just nothing, and God will curse you if you do wrong when it is easy to do right. He may just curse you anyway if He feels like it!

Excerpted Letter, Elizabeth Hardwick to Caroline Blackwood

Dear Caroline: I have told Harriet that you are having a baby by her father. It seems to me that she will have to meet her new family, to be with you and Cal and your children before the baby comes in order to make real everything that seems unimaginable to her—England, a new family for her father. <begin_diff_2> She knows that she will have very little of him from now on and that he belongs to you and all of your children, since his physical presence there and absence here is the most real thing. <end_diff>
